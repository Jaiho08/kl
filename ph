Remediation: Update to OpenSSL version 1.1.1l or later to address this vulnerability. ‚Äã
General Recommendations:

Regular Updates: Regularly update software packages to their latest stable versions to mitigate known vulnerabilities.‚Äã
Patch Management: Implement a robust patch management process to ensure timely application of security patches.‚Äã
Security Monitoring: Continuously monitor security advisories from software vendors and relevant security communities to stay informed about emerging threats and vulnerabilities.‚Äã
By addressing these vulnerabilities promptly, organizations can enhance the security and reliability of their systems.


Vulnerability: Weak TLS Cipher Suites in Use
Description:
The output from the nmap scan indicates that the target server supports several weak cipher suites, particularly those using AES-CBC, RSA key exchange, and DHE with small key sizes. These ciphers are considered weak due to known vulnerabilities such as:

AES-CBC Cipher Weakness: Susceptible to padding oracle attacks (e.g., BEAST, Lucky13).
RSA Key Exchange: Lacks forward secrecy, making it vulnerable to retrospective decryption if private keys are compromised.
DHE with 2048-bit Key: While better than lower key sizes, it is still considered weaker compared to ECDHE.
Impact:
Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: Attackers can exploit weaknesses in RSA key exchange and AES-CBC to decrypt traffic.
Lack of Forward Secrecy: If an attacker gains access to the private key, past communications can be decrypted.
Potential Downgrade Attacks: Attackers could force clients to use weaker cipher suites, exposing them to known cryptographic attacks.
Remediation:
Disable Weak Ciphers: Remove support for AES-CBC, RSA key exchange, and weak DHE ciphers.
Enforce Strong Ciphers: Enable only TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 with strong ciphers such as:
ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305
Ensure Forward Secrecy: Prefer ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) over RSA/DHE for key exchange.
Upgrade OpenSSL and Web Server Configuration: Update to the latest OpenSSL version and configure the server to prioritize strong cipher suites.



Apache Secure TLS Configuration
To disable weak ciphers and enforce strong encryption, modify the Apache configuration file (httpd.conf or ssl.conf) as follows:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Update SSL Configuration
Edit the SSL configuration file, typically located at:

/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf (Red Hat-based systems)
/etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf (Debian-based systems)
Add or update the following directives:

apache
Copy
Edit
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName example.com
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/example.com.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/example.com.key
    SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt

    # Enforce TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 (Disable TLS 1.1 and older)
    SSLProtocol all -SSLv3 -TLSv1 -TLSv1.1

    # Strong Cipher Suites (Disable Weak Ciphers)
    SSLCipherSuite HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5:!3DES:!CAMELLIA:!RSA:!AES128
    SSLHonorCipherOrder on

    # Enable Forward Secrecy
    SSLUseStapling on
    SSLSessionTickets Off

    # Enable HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
    Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"

    # Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
    RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]
</VirtualHost>
2Ô∏è‚É£ Restart Apache
After making changes, restart Apache for the new settings to take effect:

bash
Copy
Edit
systemctl restart httpd   # For Red Hat-based systems
systemctl restart apache2 # For Debian-based systems
üîπ Spring Boot Secure TLS Configuration
For a Spring Boot application using embedded Tomcat, configure strong TLS settings in application.properties or application.yml.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Update application.properties
Add the following to src/main/resources/application.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
server.port=8443
server.ssl.enabled=true
server.ssl.protocol=TLS
server.ssl.enabled-protocols=TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3
server.ssl.ciphers=TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
server.ssl.key-store=classpath:keystore.p12
server.ssl.key-store-password=changeit
server.ssl.key-store-type=PKCS12
server.ssl.key-alias=myalias
2Ô∏è‚É£ Update application.yml (Alternative)
If using YAML, modify application.yml instead:

yaml
Copy
Edit
server:
  port: 8443
  ssl:
    enabled: true
    protocol: TLS
    enabled-protocols: TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3
    ciphers: 
      - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
      - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
    key-store: classpath:keystore.p12
    key-store-password: changeit
    key-store-type: PKCS12
    key-alias: myalias
3Ô∏è‚É£ Generate a Secure Keystore
If not already created, generate a secure keystore using the Java Keytool:


keytool -genkey -alias myalias -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 365 -keystore keystore.p12 -storetype PKCS12 -storepass changeit
Move keystore.p12 to src/main/resources/ in your Spring Boot project.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Restart the Spring Boot Application
Restart the application to apply the changes:


mvn spring-boot:run   # If using Maven
./gradlew bootRun     # If using Gradle
üîπ Verification
After configuring, verify using nmap:

nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 example.com
You should see only TLS 1.2/TLS 1.3 and strong ciphers enabled.
