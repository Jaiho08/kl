The HTTP response headers for the file IMG_20250323_195710.jpg are missing several critical security headers, which could expose the application to various web-based attacks. The absence of these headers increases the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and other client-side attacks. Additionally, the presence of Content-Security-Policy: unsafe-inline is a security misconfiguration that allows the execution of inline scripts, further increasing the risk of XSS attacks.

Missing Security Headers:
Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS): The absence of the Strict-Transport-Security header means that the browser is not forced to use HTTPS, which could lead to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

Content-Security-Policy (CSP): The current CSP includes unsafe-inline, which is a security risk. A properly configured CSP should restrict the use of inline scripts and styles.

X-Content-Type-Options: The header is present but misspelled as nosnif instead of nosniff, which could render it ineffective.

Permissions-Policy: This header is missing, which could allow the use of certain browser features that might be exploited, such as geolocation, camera, microphone, etc.

Expect-CT: This header is missing, which could allow certificate misissuance to go unnoticed.

Impact:
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of a properly configured CSP and the presence of unsafe-inline could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into the web page.

Clickjacking: The absence of the X-Frame-Options header or a properly configured CSP could allow attackers to embed the site in an iframe, leading to clickjacking attacks.

Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: The absence of the Strict-Transport-Security header could allow attackers to downgrade the connection from HTTPS to HTTP, leading to MITM attacks.

MIME Sniffing: The misspelled X-Content-Type-Options header could allow browsers to MIME-sniff the content type, leading to potential security issues.

Remediation:
Implement HSTS:

Add the Strict-Transport-Security header to enforce HTTPS. Example: Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload.

Configure Content-Security-Policy (CSP):

Remove unsafe-inline and configure a strict CSP that only allows trusted sources for scripts, styles, and other resources. Example: Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self';.

Correct X-Content-Type-Options:

Correct the spelling of the X-Content-Type-Options header to nosniff. Example: X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff.

Add Permissions-Policy:

Add the Permissions-Policy header to restrict the use of certain browser features. Example: Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=().

Add Expect-CT Header:

Add the Expect-CT header to enforce Certificate Transparency. Example: Expect-CT: enforce, max-age=86400.

Review and Test:

Regularly review and test the security headers to ensure they are correctly configured and effective.

Use tools like SecurityHeaders to analyze and improve your headers.

By implementing these remediation steps, you can significantly reduce the risk of web-based attacks and improve the overall security posture of your application.

Vulnerability Description:
Cross-Site Tracing (XST) is a security vulnerability that occurs when a web server is configured to accept the HTTP TRACE method. The TRACE method is typically used for debugging purposes, as it echoes back the received request to the client. However, if an attacker can induce a victim's browser to send a TRACE request, they can potentially steal sensitive information such as cookies or authentication tokens, especially if these are not protected by the HttpOnly flag. This vulnerability is often exploited in conjunction with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

Impact:
Information Disclosure: Attackers can use XST to steal sensitive information such as session cookies, authentication tokens, or other data that is included in HTTP headers.

Session Hijacking: By stealing session cookies, attackers can hijack user sessions and impersonate the victim, gaining unauthorized access to their accounts.

Increased Attack Surface: XST can be used in combination with other vulnerabilities, such as XSS, to escalate the impact of an attack.

Compliance Violations: If sensitive data is exposed, this could lead to violations of compliance standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS.

Remediation:
Disable the TRACE Method:

Configure your web server to disable the TRACE method
