PII Exposure in Analytics Tool

In the current application setup, user email addresses are being captured and transmitted to Heap Analytics, a third-party analytics platform, post-authentication. This data is being sent in cleartext or identifiable form, making it accessible not only to Heap but also potentially visible to:

Third-party vendors with access to Heap (e.g., SIEM or observability platforms)

Internal teams such as the production team or integration team

Malicious insiders or compromised accounts

Since the email address is a form of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) under data protection laws (such as GDPR, CCPA), its improper exposure poses a serious privacy risk.

This leakage allows for unauthorized user identification, which can lead to targeted phishing attacks, identity theft, and breaches of user trust.

  Impact
Violation of GDPR / Data Privacy Laws
Exposure of users’ email addresses without proper consent or protection mechanisms may lead to non-compliance with GDPR, particularly:

Article 5 (Principles relating to processing of personal data)

Article 32 (Security of processing)

Article 33 & 34 (Notification of a personal data breach)

Article 83 (Penalties)

Penalty Clause (Article 83.5(a)):
Violations of the basic principles for processing (Article 5, 6, 7, and 9) are subject to administrative fines up to €20 million or 4% of annual global turnover, whichever is higher.

Data Breach Risk
If Heap or internal access points are compromised, user emails could be harvested and used for:

Phishing or impersonation attacks

Credential stuffing (if reused)

Spam campaigns or doxxing

Reputation Damage & Legal Liability
A privacy breach could lead to:

Loss of customer trust

Reputational harm

Regulatory investigations and lawsuits

✅ Recommendations
Avoid Sending Raw Email to Third Parties

Do not send email IDs or other sensitive PII to Heap or any third-party analytics vendor unless absolutely necessary.

If user identification is required, use non-PII identifiers (e.g., internal user ID or UUID).

Use Hashed or Tokenized IDs (If Identification Is Needed)

If email data is essential, use one-way hashes (e.g., SHA-256) with salt to obscure real values.

Implement Consent & Data Classification

Ensure explicit user consent is obtained for sharing analytics data with third parties.

Classify user email as sensitive and restrict how and where it’s used.

Audit and Restrict Access

Conduct regular audits of who can access Heap data (SIEM, integrations, etc.).

Enforce least privilege access control on analytics and production platforms.

Mask Sensitive Fields in Heap

Use Heap’s blocking and redaction features to prevent auto-capturing of form fields or URLs containing PII.

Review Third-Party Contracts

Sign a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with Heap and ensure they are GDPR-compliant.

Monitor third-party handling of user data regularly.

Implement Security Logging & Monitoring

Set up alerts for suspicious access to Heap data or analytics dashboards.

Log access to sensitive event data and investigate anomalies.
