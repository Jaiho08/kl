🔓 Vulnerability Title:
Insecure Storage of Aura Tokens

📝 Description:
Salesforce Aura framework tokens are being stored in the browser's local storage. Local storage is accessible via JavaScript and lacks built-in security features like HttpOnly or Secure flags. This makes it vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

⚠️ Impact:
An attacker exploiting an XSS vulnerability could steal the stored token, impersonate a legitimate user, gain unauthorized access to Salesforce data, and potentially perform malicious actions on behalf of the user.

✅ Recommendation:
Avoid storing sensitive tokens like Aura tokens in local storage.

Use secure, HttpOnly, and Secure cookies for session/token storage.

Implement strong Content Security Policies (CSP) and sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS.

Ensure tokens have short lifespans and support automatic expiration and renewal.
