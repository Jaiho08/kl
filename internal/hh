The application sets cookies in HTTP responses without consistently applying critical security attributes. Analysis of various HTTP responses reveals that:

Some cookies are missing the HttpOnly flag, allowing them to be accessed via JavaScript, increasing the risk of token theft via XSS.

Other cookies lack the Secure flag, meaning they could be transmitted over unencrypted HTTP connections, exposing them to interception (e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks).

This inconsistency across different requests indicates an incomplete or misconfigured cookie handling policy, which weakens the overall session security model.

 Impact:
Session Hijacking: Cookies without HttpOnly can be stolen via XSS.

Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (MitM): Cookies without the Secure flag may be transmitted over plaintext HTTP, making them vulnerable to interception.

Non-compliance: Violates OWASP Secure Coding Guidelines and may raise red flags in security audits.


  Recommendation:
Set the HttpOnly Flag

Prevents client-side scripts from accessing sensitive cookies.




Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; HttpOnly
Set the Secure Flag

Ensures cookies are only sent over HTTPS connections.


Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; Secure
Combine with SameSite Attribute

Adds protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).


Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict
Apply to All Sensitive Cookies:

Include session, authentication, and any other cookie that handles sensitive or stateful information.
