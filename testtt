Vulnerability Description
The scan reveals the use of weak cipher suites (AES-CBC) and NULL compression in TLS 1.2, which expose the system to known cryptographic attacks.

AES-CBC ciphers are susceptible to BEAST, POODLE, and LUCKY13 attacks, which allow attackers to recover encrypted data by exploiting padding weaknesses.
NULL compression (if enabled in TLS 1.2) makes the system vulnerable to CRIME attacks, where attackers exploit compressed HTTPS requests to steal sensitive data.
Although TLS 1.3 does not support these insecure configurations, the presence of these weaknesses in TLS 1.2 can lead to data exposure, MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks, and session hijacking if not mitigated.

Impact
Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks – Attackers can decrypt intercepted communications, leading to data leaks.
Session Hijacking – Exploiting weak ciphers can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to user sessions.
Data Exfiltration via Compression Attacks – If TLS compression is enabled, attackers can exploit CRIME attacks to extract sensitive information from encrypted traffic.
Compliance Risks – Use of weak ciphers may lead to non-compliance with security standards like PCI DSS, HIPAA, and NIST.


Remediation
✅ Disable AES-CBC ciphers in TLS 1.2:

Use only AES-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305, which offer stronger encryption.
Update the TLS configuration to exclude CBC-based cipher suites.
✅ Disable TLS Compression (if enabled):

Ensure TLSCompression is disabled in the server configuration to prevent CRIME attacks.
✅ Prefer TLS 1.3 over TLS 1.2:

Enforce TLS 1.3 for all secure communications.
Restrict TLS 1.2 usage to modern, secure ciphers.
✅ Regular Security Audits:

Continuously scan and update cryptographic configurations to comply with security best practices.





Vulnerability: Weak Authentication for Sensitive Account Changes
Description:
The application allows users to change sensitive account details, such as email or profile information, without requiring additional authentication, such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), or a memorable phrase. This introduces a security risk where an attacker, who has obtained the user's credentials (via phishing, brute force, or credential stuffing), can modify key account information without further verification.

Additionally, if the application does not require the user to re-enter their existing password before making changes, it further weakens security, as an attacker with session access could modify details without needing any credentials.

Impact:
Account Takeover (ATO): An attacker who gains access to the user's session or login credentials can change the email address, allowing them to reset the password and lock out the legitimate user.
Identity Fraud: Users' personal information can be altered without proper verification, leading to identity fraud and potential financial loss.
Non-Compliance with Security Standards: Failing to implement strong authentication violates industry regulations such as PCI-DSS, NIST, and ISO 27001, which require MFA for sensitive transactions.
Session Hijacking Exploitation: If an attacker hijacks a session, they can alter account details without needing the user's password, leading to further security risks.
Remediation:
✅ Require Re-authentication: Users must re-enter their current password before making any changes to sensitive account information (such as email updates).
✅ Enforce MFA/2FA: Before modifying sensitive data, the system should prompt for MFA verification (e.g., OTP, authenticator app, or security key).
✅ Implement Memorable Phrase Verification: If MFA is not available, require the user to verify a memorable phrase before allowing account modifications.
✅ Confirm Email Change: Send a verification link to the old email before updating to a new email to prevent unauthorized changes.
✅ Log and Monitor Account Changes: Maintain audit logs for any account modifications and alert users of suspicious activity.

By implementing these security controls, the application can prevent unauthorized changes, mitigate the risk of account takeovers, and align with PCI-DSS security requirements
Vulnerability: Insecure Exposure of Sensitive User Information in Web Application
Description:
A transaction-based web application is exposing sensitive user information (such as email IDs, names, account numbers, addresses, and phone numbers) after authentication in response to web requests. This issue allows any authenticated user to view personal information without additional security controls, leading to data leakage and potential regulatory non-compliance.

Even though the user is authenticated, displaying sensitive personal data openly in the application increases the risk of unauthorized access, session hijacking, and data harvesting by malicious actors through techniques like cross-site scripting (XSS), session fixation, or Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
Impact:
Data Privacy Violation

Exposing PII without encryption or access restrictions violates PCI-DSS and GDPR compliance.
Attackers could harvest user information for phishing attacks and social engineering.
Account Takeover (ATO) Risk

If attackers gain access to personal details, they can attempt password resets, identity fraud, or financial fraud in transaction-based applications.
Regulatory & Compliance Violations

Violates PCI-DSS Requirement 6.5.5 (preventing information leakage).
May result in legal penalties if PII is leaked under GDPR, CCPA, or other data protection laws.
Increased Attack Surface

Data exposure allows attackers to enumerate user accounts, leading to brute force attacks or targeted exploits against specific users.
Remediation & Mitigation:
✅ 1. Implement Data Masking

Hide sensitive details in the UI (e.g., mask email IDs: u***@domain.com and phone numbers: XXX-XXX-1234).
✅ 2. Enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Ensure that only authorized users (e.g., admin or account holder) can view or modify sensitive information.
✅ 3. Encrypt Data in Transit and at Rest

Use TLS 1.3 for secure data transmission.
Encrypt stored user data using AES-256 to prevent unauthorized access.
✅ 4. Implement Session Security & Re-authentication

Require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) before allowing users to update critical details like email or phone numbers.
Enforce session expiration and secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite).
✅ 5. Prevent Unauthorized Information Disclosure

Avoid exposing account numbers, PII, or transaction details directly on web pages.
Use tokenized identifiers instead of displaying raw data.
✅ 6. Monitor and Log Data Access

Enable logging for all user profile views, edits, and sensitive data retrievals.
Set up real-time alerts for unusual access patterns.

Vulnerability: Weak Authentication with no email confirmation for any change in profile
Description:
The application allows users to change sensitive account details, such as their email or profile information, without requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA), a memorable phrase, or even the existing password. This introduces a significant security risk, as unauthorized users who have obtained login credentials can modify account details without additional verification.

Additionally, the system does not enforce email confirmation when an email address is changed, making it easier for attackers to hijack accounts by altering contact information without user approval.

Impact:
Account Takeover (ATO): An attacker with stolen credentials can change the email address and lock out the legitimate user, leading to potential fraud or unauthorized access.
Identity Theft & Phishing Risks: A malicious user can modify profile details to impersonate a legitimate user, leading to social engineering attacks.
Non-Compliance with Security Standards (PCI-DSS, NIST, ISO 27001): Failure to implement MFA for sensitive changes violates industry regulations, potentially leading to compliance penalties.
Lack of Accountability: Without requiring the existing password or email confirmation, legitimate users have no control over unauthorized modifications.
Weak Security Controls: Without additional authentication steps, brute force or credential stuffing attacks become more effective in gaining persistent access.
Remediation:
✅ Require MFA (2FA) or a memorable phrase before allowing changes to sensitive account details.
✅ Mandate entering the existing password before updating key information (e.g., email, phone number).
✅ Implement an email confirmation process that requires verification via the old email before completing the change.
✅ Log all sensitive account modifications and alert users when a change occurs.
✅ Monitor for suspicious activity, such as frequent profile changes, and implement risk-based authentication (RBA).
